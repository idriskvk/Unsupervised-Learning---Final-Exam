# Unsupervised Learning - Final Exam
This is my Solution for the Final Exam I had in my Machine Learning Class.


Assignment Description:

Your goal is to take the position of a consultant. Your client has given you the data from a recently-conducted survey in order to understand the mobile app landscape in the United States. Your goal is to 1) find one significant, actionable market need (PCA) in which your client can develop an app to fulfill, and 2) find one significant market segment (clustering) they can target with their new app. You may combine PCA and clustering in order to make your analysis. Also, you may choose to target more market needs/segments as you see fit. In the end, the client would like to develop one, and only one app.


For the final exam, I did a Principal Component Analysis on Survey Data collected regarding Application Download Behaviour 
in order to provide valuable insights and a recommendation for the marketing department.
Furthermore, I identified the ideal Customer Segment for the chosen Principal Component by doing Clustering.

The survey data, the code, my Analysis Write-Up and the Excel sheets are attached.

I really enjoyed this Exam. Unsupervised Learning really brought my Machine Learning Skills to the next Level.
I want to thank my Instructor Chase Kusterer for his great Support throughout my Machine Learning Class.
